## Busuu Backend Engineer Test (NodeJS)

The main goal is create a new project with two API endpoints.
- Get all Exercises
- Create an Exercise

The implementation I have done is more complex that it needs to be considering the main goal, however
this is how I would setup a new project thinking on the excitability.

## Setup
### Requirements
1. node
2. docker

### Installation
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Running the app
```bash
$ docker-compose up

$ npm run start

$ npm run migrations:run
```

App running in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Use-cases
- Users
  - View all users: `GET` to `http://localhost:3000/users`
  - Create: `POST` to `http://localhost:3000/users`
    body example: { name: 'exampleName' }
- Exercises
  - View all exercises: `GET` to `http://localhost:3000/exercises`
  - Create: `POST` to `http://localhost:3000/exercises`, 
    body example: { userId: '36a24320-418a-4ff8-bd00-12ca6ce2e19f', content: 'exercise content' }

## Notes
- This test has been implemented using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript.
- Using docker for postgres and node to run the app locally.
- Separating modules by responsibilities.
- Basic DDD approach with hexagonal architecture.
- Easy understand from the folder structure to know what the application is doing just by reading 
  the use cases
- The migration infrastructure is setup to be used, I mean it's not autogenerated.
- Using typeorm, but not using Active Record, so using data mapper pattern by repositories.
- There is coupling in the entities at the domain level ðŸ¤®, which is wrong. 
  The correct thing to do would be to have an implementation at the infrastructure level 
  and avoid the coupling at domain level.
- I added a test file for the use-case to create an exercise. I had some problems mocking the repository, 
  but I left the test implemented as it should, with the mention that with more time I would create a
  different implementation for that.
- Created some custom exceptions at domain level. I could create more and with more details.
- Using class-validator to validate body requests (Not domain rules).
